Here's how it's set up.

All Mouse versions of all players are the same, because you can only have one mouse.

All keyboard versions are set up to different regions of the keyboard, so that you can hook up 
multiple keyboards, which are recognised as the same, and have more room for the players' hands.

All Controller inputs are set up to work per individual controller.
Joystick works using the controller selection (1-2-3-4)
Button only works when joystick is set in the name ("joystick 1 button 0")
